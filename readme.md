If your ever confused you can always use !help

Reddit is very intuitive, just use subreddits and users like you would on the site. Simply use rr for subreddits and ru for users as demonstrated here:

**ru [user]**

**rr [subreddit]**

You can also connect your account using **!connect [your name here]** *(no u/)*. The bot will send a message to you through reddit so you can verify your account. You can then use **rme** to view your connected account!
