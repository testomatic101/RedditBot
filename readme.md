Reddit is very intuitive, just use subreddits and users like you would on the site. Simply use rr for subreddits and ru for users as demonstrated here:

**ru [user]**

**rr [subreddit]**

![rr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BWACpro/RedditBot/master/assets/examples/rr.PNG)

You can also connect your account using **!connect [your name here]** *(no u/)*. The bot will send a message to you through reddit so you can verify your account. You can then use **rme** to view your connected account!
